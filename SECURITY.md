## Reporting a Vulnerability

2. **Include necessary details**: Provide as much information as possible about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it and any potential impact.
3. **Be patient**: We will respond to your report as quickly as possible and work with you to address the issue. Please allow us some time to investigate and provide updates.
