## Reporting a Vulnerability

At WebPy, we take security seriously. If you discover any security-related issues or vulnerabilities within the project, please report them to us immediately. We appreciate your help in making WebPy safe and secure for everyone.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Privately disclose the issue**: Send an email to [security@webpy.org](mailto:security@webpy.org) with details of the vulnerability. Please do not disclose the issue publicly until we have had a chance to assess and address it.
2. **Include necessary details**: Provide as much information as possible about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it and any potential impact.
3. **Be patient**: We will respond to your report as quickly as possible and work with you to address the issue. Please allow us some time to investigate and provide updates.
